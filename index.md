# Overview
On DIME, datasets are quick to upload, then easy to standardize, annotate, and publish on plaforms such as figshare.

The core principle is to start working with your data, **in its current state**, while breaking down the hurdles to getting it published in popular data repositories. This is achieved by combining our core features into one user friendly experience. 

# Core Features

## Short, Ubiquitous Tasks

Once uploaded, your dataset is parsed to produce tasks that improve the quality of your data. Tasks are designed to be short, completeing one should not take longer than a few minutes. One of the most common tasks on the platform requires you to use our standard definition search to match a single variable from a dataset.

In addition, tasks are meant to be ubiquitous. This is achieved by making tasks available on mobile, and presenting you with a continous stream of tasks from the moment you login. No need to navigate anywhere, if there are more tasks to do, the next one be sent to you the moment you complete the current one.

DIME tasks cut through the monotony of the traditional publication process, so you can focus on your research, while 
growing your contributions to standardized, annotated, high quality data.
